### Project Description
This project predicts user emotions through a series of targeted questions and captures their image for further analysis.
By identifying feelings such as happiness, sadness, anger, and stress, it offers personalized suggestions aimed at helping users return to a neutral emotional¬†state.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This project tackles the absurd problem of emotional neutrality, helping users recognize and engage with their feelings.
By prompting users to identify their emotions and providing tailored suggestions, it encourages them to break free from emotional indifference and enhance their overall¬†well-being.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our app helps users identify their emotions through fun questions and provides light-hearted suggestions. 
Whether it's biryani for sadness or a gym video for anger, we aim to bring smiles and help users¬†feel¬†better!
